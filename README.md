# REST API in Spring Boot

Most of the applications you use these days follow the Client-Server Architecture. The Application itself is considered the Client or the Front-End part, and it needs to talk to a Server or the Back-End to load or pull the data. This communication is established with the help of the HTTP protocol, and yes, itâ€™s the same protocol that powers our Web.

The Client can directly call the HTTP Services exposed on a Server by sending HTTP requests. This is where REST APIs come into the picture. REST is basically a convention for building these HTTP Web Services. A REST API like Spring Boot REST API can help you retrieve information from another system.

## Projects

### 1. Course

This has just one class `Course` where multiple operations are being performed. Normal CRUD operations are there.

### 2. Wallet

This can be used for expense tracking. Multiple users can register and create their own category as well. Once categories are created, transactions can be created.
